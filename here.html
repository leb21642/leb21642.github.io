	<p>My first study abroad trip was at the age of fifteen. I went on my town's Sister-City Exchange Program.
	I went through an essay and interview process to be selected to go.  There was a total of six students and 
	one chaperone. We all were assigned to live in different Japanese house holds.  This was my first time 
	ever even being on a plane and it was across the world. </p>
	<h4><b>Greece and Italy:</b></h4>

	<p>My second study abroad trip was at the age of nineteen.  I was in a boot and flew out all by myself and met 
	the rest of the students.  We went to Greece for two weeks and Italy one week. I took leadership classes and did 
	services projects as well.</p>
