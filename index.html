			<H2>Why study abroad?</h2>
			
			<p>So, you must be thinking to yourself, <span style="color:red;fount-weight:bold">why study abroad?</span> Iâ€™ll tell
			you why it is an experience you will never forget.  Aside from all the
			obvious fun you get to experience new cultures, learn history, visit 
			beautiful sights, and on top everything you get to see life from different
			perspectives.  I learned so much from my trips.  I became more independent 
			and open-minded.  I was able to meet new lifelong friends that become like 
			family.  You can also give back to communities by doing services projects 
			or even get some of your college courses out of the way!  The best part is 
			that you are given such freedom but you still have schedule so that you 
			can take in all there is to offer.  It may seem scary to go out on your own
			but after you give yourself that push you will wonder why you never did it 
			before. Are you interested?
